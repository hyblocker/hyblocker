## Hi! Welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a graphics programmer, and find low-level programming, driver development, virtual reality, game development and graphics programming to be really interesting. I am mostly known for my own independent projects, which are, in no particular order of significance:

---

- [**FreeScuba**](https://github.com/hyblocker/freescuba), a set of custom drivers for Diver-X ContactGloves, which aim to improve latency, reliability, and tracking fidelity over the stock drivers.
- [**My Space Calibrator Fork**](https://github.com/hyblocker/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator), a fork of OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator designed to improve performance, reliability, and improve the UI/UX of the driver.
- [**Hekky Shaders**](https://docs.hyblocker.dev/en/shaders/hekky-atmosphere/what-is-hekky-atmosphere/), a collection of shaders which compliment Hekky PBR, aiming to allow for higher fidelity visuals in Unity with relative ease, all while aiming for high performance in VR.
- [**Augmented Hip**](https://github.com/aughip/augmented-hip), a custom, purely software based, virtual hip tracker, for SteamVR, which uses inverse kinematics for hip estimation, provided you have leg tracking.
- [**Hekky Shader Documentation**](https://github.com/hyblocker/hekky-shader-docs), using [Astro](https://astro.build) and custom controls, to generate a static documentation website from markdown.
- [**Amethyst Installer**](https://github.com/KinecttoVR/Amethyst-Installer), the GUI installer for [Amethyst](https://github.com/KinectToVR/Amethyst).
- [**Pixelcord**](https://github.com/hyblocker/pixelcord), a now unmaintained theme for the popular social platform [Discord](https://discord.com).
